# PIX (Python Image eXplorer)

PIX is a powerful Python library and software stack for image analysis, search, and visualization. It provides a comprehensive set of functionalities to manage image databases, detect duplicates, compute clip embeddings, perform similarity-based image retrieval, and visualize datasets. PIX is designed to be versatile, allowing integration with other tools and frameworks to create complete image analysis and exploration software.

## Features

- **Duplicate Image Detection**: PIX includes algorithms to detect duplicate images within a database, helping users identify and manage duplicate entries efficiently.
- **Clip Embedding Computation**: The library enables the computation of clip embeddings for images, allowing for semantic understanding and similarity comparison based on textual prompts.
- **Similarity-Based Image Retrieval**: PIX provides functionality to search for visually similar images based on a given prompt or query, leveraging clip embeddings for accurate and efficient retrieval.
- **Image Database Management**: PIX allows users to manage image databases, including storing images, associated metadata, and computed embeddings.
- **Dataset Visualization**: The library offers tools to visualize datasets in 2D or 3D representations, enabling users to explore and gain insights into the distribution and relationships within the dataset.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `pix/`: The PIX library package containing the core functionalities.
- `notebooks/`: Example notebooks demonstrating the usage of the PIX library.
- `app/`: The complete software stack utilizing the PIX library, including a FastAPI app, a Streamlit app, and integration modules for Redis, Celery, and a vector database.
- `.github/`: GitHub Actions workflows for linting, testing, and CI/CD.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose file for building and managing the whole stack.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for building the PIX library and associated app.
- `requirements.txt`: Required dependencies for the project.
- `setup.py`: Packaging file for the PIX library.
- `README.md`: Documentation and instructions for the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with PIX, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pix.git
